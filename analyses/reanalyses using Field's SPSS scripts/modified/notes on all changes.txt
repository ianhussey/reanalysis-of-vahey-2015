"h_s syntax.sps" -> "h_s syntax modified.sps"

- code at the start of the original script that renamed variables and dropped empty rows was removed, as it was not needed for this dataset.
- 80% CRs were changed to 95% CRs as that's what Vahey et al. (2015) reported.
- The script requires reliability estimates to run but Vahey et al. (2015) did not report any. Rather than modify the code to remove this requirement, I created dummy values in the dataset, setting all reliability estimates to 1.0.


"h_s syntax modified.sps" -> "h_s syntax modified weighted r and forest plot n.sps"

- These two scripts are actually identical, the new one only changes the instruction about which data file to have open on which to run the analyses.
- This analysis speculatively explored the possibility that perhaps Vahey et al. (2015) ran their meta-analysis on the 56 individual weighted effect sizes rather than than the 15 weighted average effect sizes. 


"Meta_Basic_r.sps" -> "Meta_Basic_r modified.sps"

- code at the start of the original script that gets variables was dropped, as it is run on the loaded dataset instead.
- removed code to launch the R script to add additional publication bias metrics, ie 

*insert  file="Launch_Pub_Bias_r.sps".

- borrowed code from "h_s syntax.sps" to ensure that CRs are non-negative.  

Old code:

compute sdrho = sqrt(vrho).

New code:

*if the variance in corrected correlations has a negative value, it indicates that the variance of corrected correlation is 0
(the variance attributable to artifacts is actually grater than the observed variance).
*do if - also, because the sqrt can not be obtained for negative values.

do if (vrho >=0).
compute sdrho = sqrt(vrho).
end if.

do if (vrho < 0).
compute sdrho = 0.
end if.
