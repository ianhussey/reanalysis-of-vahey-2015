## Vahey, Nicholson & Barnes-Holmes 2015 supplimentary materials.xslx

Supplementary Online materials available with the Vahey et al 2015 manuscript

## data_vahey_et_al_2015.csv 

Combination of the effect sizes reported in Vahey's supplementary materials (above) and the weighted mean effect sizes reported in the forest plot in their manuscript. The forest plot contains both numeric values and graphical ones. The graphical values were extracted visually to check agreement.

## data_reextracted_and_annotated

All studies that had effect sizes extracted from them that were listed in data_for_meta_analysis_vahey.csv were manually reinspected. First, the same effect sizes were found and reextracted (and converted if necessary). Second, all other IRAP-criterion effect sizes were also extracted (and converted if necessary).

problematic_analysis variable: this was defined as analyses that examine the presence of a given IRAP effect (i.e., non-zero mean *D* scores or significant differenes between the con and incon blocks) or where the IRAP D scores were the DV rather than the IV (which is not clinically useful).
