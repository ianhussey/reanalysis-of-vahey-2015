Supplementary Online materials available with the Vahey et al 2015 manuscript

### data_vahey_et_al_2015.csv 

Combination of the effect sizes reported in Vahey's supplementary materials (above) and the weighted mean effect sizes reported in the forest plot in their manuscript. 

problematic_analysis variable: this was defined as analyses that examine the presence of a given IRAP effect (i.e., non-zero mean *D* scores or significant differenes between the con and incon blocks) or where the IRAP D scores were the DV rather than the IV (which is not clinically useful).

These are used in the analyses to attempt to computationally reproduce Vahey's meta-analyses.

## data_reextracted_and_annotated

All studies that had effect sizes extracted from them that were listed in data_for_meta_analysis_vahey.csv were manually reinspected. First, the same effect sizes were found and reextracted (and converted if necessary). Second, all other IRAP-criterion effect sizes were also extracted (and converted if necessary).

These are used in the analyses when quantifying discrepencies between Vahey's results and my reextractions, and in the new meta analyses.
