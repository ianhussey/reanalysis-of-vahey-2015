## Extension of original analyses

Taking originally included effect sizes, reextract, convert, and analyze meta effect size, and calculate power.

Excluding effect sizes that fail to meet Vahey's own criteria, reextract, convert, and analyze meta effect size, and calculate power.

Excluding problematic effect sizes based on generic pattern, and effect sizes that fail to meet Vahey's own criteria, reextract, convert, and analyze meta effect size, and calculate power.

Note that (a) the meta is ultimately meaningless as it confuses IV and DV, and (b) that the inclusion criteria are entirely post hoc.

Is it even meaningful to take all effect sizes reported in original manuscripts, reextract, convert, and analyze meta effect size, and calculate power?
