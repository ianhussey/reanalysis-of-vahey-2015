fMRI reliability paper



“In a meta-meta-analysis summarizing 322 metaanalyses with more than 25'000 published studies in the field of personality and social psychology, Richard, Bond, and Stokes-Zoota (2003) report that the average published effect is r = .21, less than 25% of all meta-analytic effects sizes are greater than .30, and only 5.28% of all effects are greater than .50.” (Schönbrodt and Perugini, 2013, p. 10)

- separately, that paper shows that small ES don't produce stable correlations. yet there is little dance of the correlations in vahey's results
- i looked into Richard, Bond, and Stokes-Zoota (2003) more, and vahey's reported result of r = .46 would place it in the top >90 percentile of meta analytic correlations in psychology. again, either the IRAP is a truly exceptional measure, or something is amiss.
